## Time Moves On, But Memories Stay

Returning to Perth was an emotional rollercoaster. It was a journey back to a city I once called home, but also a journey back to a version of myself that exists only in memories now. There’s something both beautiful and painful about time’s passage, about realizing that things can never be exactly the same as they once were.

The new Perth may have taller buildings and busier streets, but the city will always be etched in my heart as the place where I discovered a new chapter of my life. And though the streets may have changed and the skyline may have grown, the memories—those precious memories—will always remain.

So, as I say goodbye to Perth once again, I do so with a heart full of gratitude. Time has moved on, but the past will always be part of me, woven into the fabric of this vibrant, ever-changing city.
