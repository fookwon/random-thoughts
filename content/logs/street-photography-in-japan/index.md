## Finding My Lens: Capturing Tokyo’s Moments with the Ricoh GR III 

As an amateur photographer still figuring out my style, my camera has become my constant companion on my trips to Japan. I walk around Tokyo with my Ricoh GR III, a camera that feels like an extension of myself—small, discreet, and quick. It’s perfect for street photography, where the goal isn’t to plan a shot but to capture the fleeting moments that catch my eye in the city’s ever-changing rhythm.

I don’t have a strict approach yet; I just snap what feels right in the moment. Some days, it’s the neon lights reflecting off wet pavement in Shibuya, other times, it’s the quiet of a shrine tucked away in Asakusa. There’s something magical about walking through these streets, letting the city guide me. I find beauty in the contrast of old and new—the traditional temples framed by skyscrapers, the mix of people in Harajuku with their bold fashion against the more subdued locals.

With every trip, I feel like I’m getting closer to understanding what I’m drawn to. Maybe it’s the spontaneous nature of street photography that excites me most—capturing not just a scene, but a fleeting, personal moment that tells a story. It’s a journey, but I’m enjoying every step of it.
